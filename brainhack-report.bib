  abstract    = "MRI, enabling in vivo analysis of cortical morphology, offers
                 a powerful tool in the assessment of brain development and
                 pathology. One of the most ubiquitous measures used-the
                 thickness of the cortex-shows abnormalities in a number of
                 diseases and conditions, but the functional and biological
                 correlates of such alterations are unclear. If the functional
                 connotations of structural MRI measures are to be understood,
                 we must strive to clarify the relationship between measures
                 such as cortical thickness and their cytoarchitectural
                 determinants. We therefore sought to determine whether
                 patterns of cortical thickness mirror a key motif of the
                 cortex, specifically its structural hierarchical organisation.
                 We delineated three sensory hierarchies (visual, somatosensory
                 and auditory) in two species-macaque and human-and explored
                 whether cortical thickness was correlated with specific
                 cytoarchitectural characteristics. Importantly, we controlled
                 for cortical folding which impacts upon thickness and may
                 obscure regional differences. Our results suggest that an
                 easily measurable macroscopic brain parameter, namely,
                 cortical thickness, is systematically related to
                 cytoarchitecture and to the structural hierarchical
                 organisation of the cortex. We argue that the measurement of
                 cortical thickness gradients may become an important way to
                 develop our understanding of brain structure-function
                 relationships. The identification of alterations in such
                 gradients may complement the observation of regionally
                 localised cortical thickness changes in our understanding of
                 normal development and neuropsychiatric illnesses.",

  abstract    = "The human cerebral cortex is vastly expanded relative to other
                 primates and disproportionately occupied by distributed
                 association regions. Here we offer a hypothesis about how
                 association networks evolved their prominence and came to
                 possess circuit properties vital to human cognition. The rapid
                 expansion of the cortical mantle may have untethered large
                 portions of the cortex from strong constraints of molecular
                 gradients and early activity cascades that lead to sensory
                 hierarchies. What fill the gaps between these hierarchies are
                 densely interconnected networks that widely span the cortex
                 and mature late into development. Limitations of the tethering
                 hypothesis are discussed as well as its broad implications for
                 understanding critical features of the human brain as a
                 byproduct of size scaling.",
