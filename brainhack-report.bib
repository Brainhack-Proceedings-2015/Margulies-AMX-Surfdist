  abstract = "We present an algorithm for determining the shortest path between
              a source and a destination on an arbitrary (possibly nonconvex)
              polyhedral surface. The path is constrained to lie on the
              surface, and distances are measured according to the Euclidean
              metric. Our algorithm runs in time $O(n^2 \l{}og n)$ and requires
              $O(n^2 )$ space, where n is the number of edges of the surface.
              After we run our algorithm, the distance from the source to any
              other destination may be determined using standard techniques in
              time $O(\l{}og n)$ by locating the destination in the subdivision
              created by the algorithm. The actual shortest path from the
              source to a destination can be reported in time $O(k + \l{}og
              n)$, where k is the number of faces crossed by the path. The
              algorithm generalizes to the case of multiple source points to
              build the Voronoi diagram on the surface, where n is now the
              maximum of the number of vertices and the number of sources.",
